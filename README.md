KokoroMusic is a music player application

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes Node.js® and an npm package manager.

### Prerequisites

Angular requires a current, active LTS, or maintenance LTS version of Node.js. See the engines key for the specific version requirements in our package.json.

**Install Node**

To check your version, run **node -v** in a terminal/console window (To get Node.js, go to nodejs.org)

**Install the Angular CLI globally.**

To install the CLI using npm, open a terminal/console window and enter the following command:
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

The Angular CLI includes a server, so that you can easily build and serve your app locally.

* Go to the workspace folder (my-app).

* Launch the server by using the CLI command ng serve, with the --open option.

```
cd my-app
ng serve --open
```

## Built With

* [Angular 8](https://angular.io/) - The web framework used
